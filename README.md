Uber Travels' Fare Price Prediction Modeling
==============================

This is an end-to-end machine learning regression problem where I built a model for predicting Uber travels' fare prices under different temporal conditions. The Root Mean Squared Error of the model is about USD 0.25 cents per prediction. The trained model has a production-ready REST API for inference.
